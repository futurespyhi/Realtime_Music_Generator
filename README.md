   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. Configure environment variables
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration
   ```

4. Set up the frontend
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

5. Run the development servers
   ```bash
   # In one terminal (backend)
   cd backend
   python manage.py runserver
   
   # In another terminal (frontend)
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Access the application at http://localhost:5173

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## üöÄ Usage

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
3. Select your desired music genre from the dropdown menu
4. Click the "Start Recording" button and begin speaking
5. The application will generate music that matches your speech in real-time
6. Click "Stop" to end the recording and finalize the music generation
7. Download your generated music track or share it directly

## üß™ Testing

```bash
