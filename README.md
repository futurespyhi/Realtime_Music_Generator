# MiloMusic - AI-Powered Speech-to-Music Generator

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-blue?style=flat&logo=github)](https://github.com/futurespyhi/Realtime_Music_Generator)

MiloMusic is an innovative web application that converts spoken words into music in real-time. Users can speak into their microphone, select their desired music genre, and the system will generate appropriate musical compositions that reflect the speech patterns, emotional tone, and lyrical content of the input.

## üéµ Features

- **Real-time Speech-to-Music Conversion**: Transform users' voice into music with low latency
- **Multiple Genre Support**: Generate music in various styles including pop, rock, jazz, classical‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
- **High Accuracy**: high user satisfaction rate with generated music quality
- **Lyrical Relevance**: Advanced NLP ensures generated lyrics maintain semantic connection to speech input
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports high concurrency with high uptime(AWS ECS's attribute: Auto Scaling - Dynamically scales container instances based on real-time voice request volume)
- **Targeted Fine-tunning**: Creates emotion-specific datasets(happy/sad/angry) and retrains Spark TTS's prosody layer to generate emotional content like love songs and angry rap

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Django
- **Speech-to-Text**: Google Chirp 2
- **Speech Processing**: Custom DeepSeek-V3 model fine-tuned with PyTorch + C++ optimizations
- **Text-to-Speech**: Spark TTS for music synthesis
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching/Session Management**: Redis
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Cloud Services**: AWS ECS
- **Service Communication**: gRPC

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React
- **Audio Interface**: Web Audio API
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Styling**: CSS Modules
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## üîß System Architecture

MiloMusic follows a microservices architecture:

1. **Speech Recognition Service**: Captures and processes audio input to text(Speech-to-text through Google Chirp2)
2. **NLP Service**: Analyzes speech content and emotional tone
3. **Music Generation Service**: Creates musical compositions based on analyzed input
4. **Frontend Application**: Provides user interface and audio playback

## üìã Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- AWS CLI (for production deployment)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MiloMusic.git
   cd MiloMusic
   ```

2. Configure environment variables
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration
   ```

3. Start the application with Docker Compose
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Access the application at http://localhost:5173

### Local Development (Alternative)

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MiloMusic.git
   cd MiloMusic
   ```

2. Set up the backend
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. Configure environment variables
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration
   ```

4. Set up the frontend
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

5. Run the development servers
   ```bash
   # In one terminal (backend)
   cd backend
   python manage.py runserver
   
   # In another terminal (frontend)
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Access the application at http://localhost:5173

## üöÄ Usage

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
3. Select your desired music genre from the dropdown menu
4. Click the "Start Recording" button and begin speaking
5. The application will generate music that matches your speech in real-time
6. Click "Stop" to end the recording and finalize the music generation
7. Download your generated music track or share it directly

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Backend tests (within Docker)
docker compose exec backend python manage.py test

# Frontend tests (within Docker)
docker compose exec frontend npm test

# Backend tests (local)
cd backend
python manage.py test

# Frontend tests (local)
cd frontend
npm test
```

## üìä Performance Metrics
